We're looking for people with curiosity and ideas about what the future of work could, or should, look like. \n\nThe ideas and prototypes will be communicated and shared with the public after the hackathon, and winning ideas will be awarded the opportunity to be part of TRR Labsâ€™ Pilot program.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"_data/application-form.yml","sha":"f62c7831be3ed7cd836c7f57beb325bdaf9b0821"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-06-11T07:47:30.624Z"}
