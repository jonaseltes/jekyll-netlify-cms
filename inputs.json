We will bring together bright minds with first-hand experience of facilitating a smooth work life for others with experts from industries and areas either affecting or being affected by the changes we see throughout society. \n\nHalf of the participants will be future-work experts from within TRR, and the other half will be thinkers, knowers, and doers from outside of TRR. We're looking for people with curiosity and ideas about what the future of work could, or should, look like. \n\nThe ideas and prototypes will be communicated and shared with the public after the hackathon, and winning ideas will be awarded the opportunity to be part of TRR Labsâ€™ Pilot program.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"_data/application-form.yml","sha":"f5b7f05dc747348f0cb86accd4998dd415b5294d"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-06-12T12:43:49.248Z"}
