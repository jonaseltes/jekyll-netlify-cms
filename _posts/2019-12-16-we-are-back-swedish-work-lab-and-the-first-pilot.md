title: 'We are back - Swedish Work Lab and the first pilot '
---
## Since the Swedish Work Lab hackathon in early September, TRR Trygghetsrådet and Another Tomorrow have been working on the three winning ideas _(link to ideas)_, how to proceed with them, what possibilities there might be and most importantly, realised how relevant and needed the first pilot is for our future work lives. Here comes a summary of what we’ve been up to the past months.

In the beginning of November, TRR and Another Tomorrow kicked off the pilot process with a "pilot task-force" diving deeper into the three winning ideas during our first workshop. We explored in more detail what they entailed, how close they were to TRR’s core business and focused on what they actually tried to solve in relation to the organisation’s future vision and a gap on the market that needed to be filled. 

We quickly found good synergies between the three ideas but decided to proceed with Future Five (or Future Index) as a first step, having the option to add bits and pieces of the other ideas further down the line. The focus would be on competence maintenance and the demand of specific skills in the future to help workers become more proactive in order to avoid unwanted gaps in their careers.
