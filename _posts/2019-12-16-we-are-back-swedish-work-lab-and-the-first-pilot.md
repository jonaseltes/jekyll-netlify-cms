title: 'We are back // Swedish Work Lab and its first pilot '
---
## Since the Swedish Work Lab hackathon in early September, TRR Trygghetsrådet and Another Tomorrow have been working on the three winning ideas _(link to ideas)_, how to proceed with them, what possibilities there might be and most importantly, realised how relevant and needed the first pilot is for our future work lives. Here comes a summary of what we’ve been up to the past months.

<h3> What happened after the hackathon? </h3>\
In the beginning of November, TRR and Another Tomorrow kicked off the pilot process with a "pilot task-force" diving deeper into the three winning ideas during our first workshop. We explored in more detail what they entailed, how close they were to TRR’s core business and focused on what they actually tried to solve in relation to the organisation’s future vision and a gap on the market that needed to be filled. 

We quickly found good synergies between the three ideas but decided to proceed with Future Five (or Future Index) as a first step, having the option to add bits and pieces of the other ideas further down the line. The focus would be on competence maintenance and the demand of specific skills in the future to help workers become more proactive in order to avoid unwanted gaps in their careers.

<h3> Hypothesis </h3>\
If companies became better at identifying their own skills gaps and map as well as plan their needs for the next two to five years, workers would have the possibility to be more agile in their career and competence planning. If we are able to identify future development paths of companies we can suggest what skills employees should have and how to add them in order to avoid gaps in their employment. We think a tool for future-proofing your career and taking proactive steps for both workers and companies is the missing piece of the puzzle. 

<h3> Next steps and focus area </h3>\
After the workshop, the core team got together and made a few decisions in order to create a clearer scope for the exploration, such as initially focusing on companies (as opposed to employees). This would be a good first step to generate and understand the data we needed to then create value for both parties. We also decided on piloting within a specific industry in order to focus on certain roles and shifts as well as not having to map out everything at once. Based on some research, trends and TRR’s experience, we decided on taking a closer look at the media industry. Not only has it been struggling due to new (social) media platforms but the role of the journalist has changed over years. We conducted structured interviews with people who’ve been working in media for several years, especially within HR, recruiting or being the key stakeholders.
