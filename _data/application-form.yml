  **Our first step towards the future...**


  On September 5th 2019 we will bring perspectives from multiple disciplines
  together for a one day hackathon, to explore and solve challenges facing the
  future workplace. We will bring together bright minds with first-hand
  experience of facilitating a smooth work life for others with experts from
  industries and areas either affecting or being affected by the changes we see
  throughout society. 


  The ideas and prototypes will be communicated and shared with the public after
  the hackathon, and winning ideas will be awarded the opportunity to be part of
  TRR Labsâ€™ Pilot program.
