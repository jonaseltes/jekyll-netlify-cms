  **Our first step towards the future...**


  On September 5th 2019 we will bring perspectives from multiple disciplines
  together for a one day hackathon, to explore and solve challenges facing the
  future workplace. We will bring together bright minds with first-hand
  experience of facilitating a smooth work life for others with experts from
  industries and areas either affecting or being affected by the changes we see
  throughout society. 


  Half of the participants will be future-work experts from within TRR, and the
  other half will be thinkers, knowers, and doers from outside of TRR. We're
  looking for people with curiosity and ideas about what the future of work
  could, or should, look like. 


  The ideas and prototypes will be communicated and shared with the public after
  the hackathon, and winning ideas will be awarded the opportunity to be part of
  TRR Labsâ€™ Pilot program.
