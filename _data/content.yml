  title: The Swedish Work Lab
intro:
  abstract: >-
    Our 21st century work lives are constantly evolving. They’re shaped by
    technological breakthroughs, new economic models, and evolving educational
    formats. Legislation catches up to ideas and re-frames how businesses can be
    run. There’s an increased expectancy on companies’ moral compass, and
    matters of ethics and sustainability may determine both where individuals
    choose to work as well as where customers choose to engage.


    The Swedish Work Lab is a platform to explore what all these parameters mean
    for employees and employers in both the near and distant future. What, and
    who, is required to make an increasingly fluid and, to a degree,
    unpredictable work life run/function smoothly?
