  title: The Swedish Work Lab
intro:
  abstract: >-
    Our 21st century work lives are constantly evolving. They’re shaped by
    technological breakthroughs, new economic models, and evolving educational
    formats. Legislation catches up to ideas and re-frames how businesses can be
    run. There’s an increased expectancy on companies’ moral compass, and
    matters of ethics and sustainability may determine both where individuals
    choose to work as well as where customers choose to engage.


    The Swedish Work Lab is a platform to explore what all these parameters mean
    for employees and employers in both the near and distant future. What, and
    who, is required to make an increasingly fluid and, to a degree,
    unpredictable work life run/function smoothly?

    About TRR


    TRR is a non-profit foundation which offers expert assistance to redundant
    white-collar staff, employers and trade union representatives in the private
    sector. Our goal is to try and make sure the time from one job to another is
    as short, effective and as meaningful as possible.


    With The Swedish Work Lab we’re taking a first step towards broader
    horizons, exploring and challenging our own role in a labour market that’s
    facing new and multi-dimensional challenges. We have ambitions to create a
    blueprint for tomorrow’s successful facilitation of a smooth and fulfilling
    work life.


    The Foundation was established in 1974 and is owned by employer associations
    in The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and unions in PTK. We have
    approximately 240 employees and are active in over 40 locations across the
    country, with our headquarters in Stockholm. About 35 000 companies with 950
    000 employees are connected to TRR.
