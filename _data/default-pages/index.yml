headline: Will you help us shape the future of work?
introduction: >-
  The Swedish Work Lab is a platform to explore what the rapid pace of change in
  society mean(s) for employees and employers in both the near and distant
  future. What does tomorrow’s work life actually look like? What previously
  unknown challenges may we be facing? What or who is required for our work
  lives to thrive?


  Our 21st century work lives are constantly evolving. They’re shaped by
  technological breakthroughs, new economic models, and evolving educational
  formats. Legislation catches up to ideas and re-frames how businesses can be
  run. There’s an increased expectancy on companies’ moral compass, and matters
  of ethics and sustainability may determine both where individuals choose to
  work as well as where customers choose to take their business. It’s up to us
  to shape the future we want to work in.

          Our first step towards the future…


          On September 5th 2019 we will bring perspectives from multiple
          disciplines together for a one day hackathon, to explore and solve
          challenges facing the future workplace. We will bring together bright
          minds with first-hand experience of facilitating a smooth work life
          for others with experts from industries and areas either affecting or
          being affected by the changes we see throughout society.


          Half of the participants will be future-work experts from within TRR,
          and the other half will be thinkers, knowers, and doers from outside
          of TRR. We’re looking for people with curiosity and ideas about what
          the future of work could, or should, look like.


          The ideas and prototypes will be communicated and shared with the
          public after the hackathon, and winning ideas will be awarded the
          opportunity to be part of TRR Labs’ Pilot program.
