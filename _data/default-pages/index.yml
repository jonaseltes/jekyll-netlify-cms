  The Swedish Work Lab is a platform to explore what the rapid pace of change in
  society mean(s) for employees and employers in both the near and distant
  future. What does tomorrow’s work life actually look like? What previously
  unknown challenges may we be facing? What or who is required for our work
  lives to thrive?


  Our 21st century work lives are constantly evolving. They’re shaped by
  technological breakthroughs, new economic models, and evolving educational
  formats. Legislation catches up to ideas and re-frames how businesses can be
  run. There’s an increased expectancy on companies’ moral compass, and matters
  of ethics and sustainability may determine both where individuals choose to
  work as well as where customers choose to take their business. It’s up to us
  to shape the future we want to work in.

          On September 5th 2019 we gathered perspectives from multiple
          disciplines together for a one day hackathon, to explore and solve
          challenges facing the future workplace. We had bright minds with
          first-hand experience of facilitating others’ work life as well as
          experts from industries and areas either affecting or being affected
          by the changes seen throughout society.
