  The Swedish Work Lab is a platform to explore what the rapid pace of change
  in society mean(s) for employees and employers in both the near and distant
  future. What does tomorrow’s work life actually look like? What previously
  unknown challenges may we be facing? What or who is required for our work
  lives to thrive?


  Our 21st century work lives are constantly evolving. They’re shaped by
  technological breakthroughs, new economic models, and evolving educational
  formats. Legislation catches up to ideas and re-frames how businesses can be
  run. There’s an increased expectancy on companies’ moral compass, and
  matters of ethics and sustainability may determine both where individuals
  choose to work as well as where customers choose to take their business.
  It’s up to us to shape the future we want to work in.
