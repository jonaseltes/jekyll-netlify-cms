  The Swedish Work Lab is a platform to explore what the rapid pace of change in
  society means for employees and employers in both the near and distant future.
  What does tomorrow’s work life actually look like? What previously unknown
  challenges may we be facing? What or who is required for our work lives to
  thrive?


  Our 21st century work lives are constantly evolving. They’re shaped by
  technological breakthroughs, new economic models, and evolving educational
  formats. Legislation catches up to ideas and re-frames how businesses can be
  run. There’s an increased expectancy on companies’ moral compass, and matters
  of ethics and sustainability may determine both where individuals choose to
  work as well as where customers choose to take their business. It’s up to us
  to shape the future we want to work in.

          On September 5th we gathered perspectives from multiple disciplines
          together for a one day hackathon, to explore and solve challenges
          facing the future workplace. The winning ideas were awarded the
          opportunity to be part of TRR Labs’ Pilot program, and will be
          explored further during the autumn.
