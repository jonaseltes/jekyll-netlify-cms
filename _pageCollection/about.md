            TRR is a non-profit foundation which offers expert assistance to
            redundant white-collar staff, employers and trade union
            representatives in the private sector. Our goal is to try and make
            sure the time from one job to another is as short, effective and as
            meaningful as possible.


            With The Swedish Work Lab we’re taking a first step towards broader
            horizons, exploring and challenging our own role in a labour market
            that’s facing new and multi-dimensional challenges. We have
            ambitions to create a blueprint for tomorrow’s successful
            facilitation of a smooth and fulfilling work life.
