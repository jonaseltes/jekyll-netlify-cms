                # Team 1: Meaningful midlife reskilling

                It’s 2025. The labour market has seen some major changes in the
                past couple of years, with some professions more or less
                disappearing altogether and formerly non-existing ones emerging.
                Careers are more fragmented and skills become outdated faster
                than ever before. If there ever was one, there is no longer the
                expectation that your university major or first job says very
                much about where you will find yourself some 40 years later.


                To many, this is not news. Years of talk of things like
                automation even before it was actually widely implemented, has
                infused a sense of acceptance. 80%, when asked, say they want to
                re-educate themselves at some point in their career, and switch
                their line of work entirely. Amongst many, there is both an
                acceptance that a single job is not for life and a willingness
                to try something new. The amount of “midlife students” is
                forecasted to triple within the next few years. 


                The options for re-educating oneself, however, are not always
                compatible with this desire, and the public education system has
                not reinvented itself at the same pace as the labour market.
                It’s mostly optimised for 19-year olds fresh out of high school
                with an unused CSN (student aid) quota, providing significant
                threshold to many mid-lifers  evaluating their options.


                Team brief:


                What demands does this particular starting point place on how we
                educate people, and how might we help this group pivot in their
                careers?
